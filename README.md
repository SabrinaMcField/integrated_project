# integrated_project

This project evaluates data from the online retailer called, Ice. They sell video games, globally. On their website, customers will find user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources to help them make buying decisions.

In this analysis, we will identify patterns that contribute to whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow Ice to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns for the next year.
